# Quick Pattern Recognition ðŸ¦¦
A variety of quick implementations of some methodologies used in pattern recognition systems.

## Spectral Analysis of Some Instrumental Pitches
A brief analysis that dive into the spectral world to better understand what characterizes differences between instruments.

## RBM: Restricted Boltzmann Machine Implementation
A very basic implementation of one of the most famous models that stands at the foundation of more complex systems, the RBM, used to encode the MNIST dataset, fed afterwards to a very simple model for classification.
## DeepAE: Deep Auto-Encoders Implementation
A look into the word of representation learning using Contractive and Denoising Autoencodes (implemented using both standard training and Greedy Unsupervised Layer-wise Pretraining).

## Trust Region Policy Optimization
A short and concise presentation the summarizes [Trust Region Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477)
